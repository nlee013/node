      Enide Gradle is alternative and completion to `Gradle Integration for Eclipse`.
See https://github.com/nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/

Launch build or Gradle GUI.
Project does not need to be Gradle project. Just `build.gradle` would be enough.
(The project may be General, old classic Java, Maven or
broken Gradle project.)
No miracles, this plugins just launches `gradle` with options, as
you can do from command line.
Full path to maven `gradle.bat` or `gradle` is used, so you can try
different versions.
Specify options to `gradle` that will be Workspace-wide.
Executed string is shown is Console, so you can check and learn.
